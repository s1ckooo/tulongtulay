          <p>
           Consider the Lily is a non-profit organization based in Manila, Philippines that provides a loving home for Filipina girls who have been exploited, abused or trafficked. A core value of ours is teaching the girls of the hope and peace of Jesus Christ and equipping them with eternal hope that is outside of this world. Many of our girls are rescued from their family homes where abuse is happening in the place that was meant to be the safest to them; some are placed here for protective custody, while others have been rescued from being exploited and sold for sex. No matter the background that led them to our family, when they move in, healing immediately begins.
