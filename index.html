	<h1>What are Non-Profit Organizations?</h1>

	<br>

	<p>A non-profit organization (NPO) is a type of organization that is dedicated to a social cause or mission rather than pursuing profits for its owners or shareholders. Non-profits are also referred to as not-for-profit organizations or charitable organizations. These organizations exist to serve the public interest and address a wide range of social, cultural, educational, religious, or environmental issues. Non-profit organizations include churches, public schools, public charities, public clinics and hospitals, amateur sports organizations, political organizations, legal aid societies, volunteer services, organizations, labor unions, professional associations, research institutes, museums, and some governmental agencies.</p>

	<br>

	
   <p>
   	In the Philippines, not-for-profit organizations (NPOs) are typically organized as "non-stock corporations" registered under the Corporation Code. Non-stock corporations may be formed for charitable, religious, educational, professional, cultural, fraternal, literary, scientific, social, civic service, or similar purposes, such as trade, industry, agricultural and similar chambers, or any combination thereof (Revised Corporation Code Section 87). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines serves as the registration authority for non-stock corporations. Some non-stock corporations register as foundations.
