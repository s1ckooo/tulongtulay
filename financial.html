             Funding is always limited, and many of theses non-profit agencies rely heavily on donations from individuals and businesses in the local community. Financial assistance is also issued with conditions, and is usually offered as a last resort when a family is faced with a crisis. The demand for help is very high, and since resources are limited, many non-profit organizations prioritize programs for families with children, senior, single mom and the disabled. In addition, charities and non-profit organizations can also help by directing low-income families or the poor to other financial assistance programs.
